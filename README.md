# Swiggy-Vadodara-Exploratory-Data-Analysis


The basic idea of analyzing the Swiggy dataset is to get a fair idea about the popularity of restraunts based on ratings and widely available cuisines among all the restaurants of vadodara. 

From the provided URL, names and ratings were extracted which were visible on the front page of the website. The data for each of the restaurants on the swiggy were recorded in the csv file, so that later the data can be extracted individually for each restaurant.

The recorded data for all restaurants and categories was read and data for each restaurant was scraped individually. 

ðŸ‘€ Vadodara has about 1400 restraunts listed on swiggy.
